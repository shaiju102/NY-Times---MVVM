# Android MVVM Architecture: Sample App
This repository contains a detailed sample app that implements MVVM architecture using Android Archtecture components like VewModel , LiveData and Data Binding.
The app basically fetch certain news feeds and list them in a recycler view

Prerequisites
--------------

- Android Studio 3.1
- Android SDK v27
- Latest Android Build Tools
- Android Support Repository

#Technology used
* Clean MVVM architecture
* [Android Databinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)


#### The app has following packages:
1. **model**: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. **view**: It contans the view classes like Activitiy, Fragment.
3. **viewmodel**: It contains the view model class that acts as a hooke between the model and the view.
4. **network**: Retrofit classes .
4. **callback**: General interfaces.

#### Steps to run the app:
Download the project code, preferably using git clone.
Open the Android SDK Manager (Tools Menu | Android) and make sure you have installed the Android testing support library Repository under Extras.
In Android Studio, select File | Open... and point to the ./build.gradle file.
Check out the relevant code:
The application under test is located in src/main/java
Tests are in src/androidTest/java
Create the test configuration with a custom runner: android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
Open Run menu | Edit Configurations
Add a new Android Tests configuration
Choose a module
Add a Specific instrumentation runner: android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
Connect a device or start an emulator
Turn animations off. (On your device, under Settings->Developer options disable the following 3 settings: "Window animation scale", "Transition animation scale" and "Animator duration scale")
Run the newly created configuration
The application will be started on the device/emulator and a series of actions will be performed automatically.

If you are using Android Studio, the Run window will show the test results.
